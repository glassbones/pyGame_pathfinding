# pyGame_pathfinding

![pyGame_demo](demo/bpy_anim.gif)

I wanted to create a maze solver that explores a maze in as few steps as possible. This led to a whole rabbit whole of problem solving and research. I'm a very visual learner so I decided to use the pyGame library to render the maze and the algorithms used to solve it.

This is currently under development but completely functional using the A star path finding algorithm paired with a custom algorithm I wrote to detect dead ends and loops inside of the maze.

I plan to add more GUI elements and path-finding algorithms in the future.
